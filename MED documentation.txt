Documentation for Minimum Distance Determiner:

This program uses a minimum edit distance matrix to determine how close two words are to 
each other.
The implementation of the principal alogorithms is in filler.py. These algortihms compute 
the minimum edit distance matrix, the distance between the two words, and also neatly 
display the distance matrix for the two words.

To run the program, execute the file MED2.0.py
The program begins by asking for:
1)The two word to be compared
2)The costs of the insert, delete, and substitution operations
The minimum distance is then displayed, and the user is given the option to view the 
distance matrix
